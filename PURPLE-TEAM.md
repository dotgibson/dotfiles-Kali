# Purple Team — detections for the attacks in `hacktheplanet`

The offensive half of an engagement lives in
[`offensive/hacktheplanet`](offensive/hacktheplanet). This file is its mirror:
**what each of those attacks looks like to the defender**, and the philosophy
behind hunting it. Field notes from TrustedSec's *Actionable Purple Teaming*
(Black Hat USA 2023), generalized out of the lab.

> Why this lives in an offensive repo: a red operator who knows exactly which
> event ID their action writes is a better operator. Every command in
> `hacktheplanet` has a telemetry footprint — knowing it is OPSEC, and validating
> it is the entire point of purple teaming.

> **Defender-authored capability lives across the fence in [`dotfiles-Defense`](https://github.com/Gerrrt/dotfiles-Defense).**
> This file is *attacker-authored* purple — "here's the telemetry I trip," next to the
> attack that trips it. Portable, deployable detection content (Sigma rules, Sysmon
> baselines, Zeek/Suricata tuning, SIEM saved-searches) and the Dockerized detection lab
> are a different job from a different seat, so they get their own blue Role repo. The
> split is deliberate: run the attack here, confirm the rule fires there.

## The philosophy

- **Purple, not red-then-blue.** Run the attack and watch the detection fire *in
  the same session*. A detection nobody has triggered on purpose is a hypothesis,
  not a control. Execute → confirm the alert → tune → repeat.
- **Detect on the invariant, not the IOC.** Tool names, file hashes and ports
  change for free. Detect the thing the technique *can't* avoid: Kerberoasting
  needs an RC4 service ticket (`4769`, downgraded encryption); DCSync needs the
  directory-replication right (`4662`); a relay produces a logon whose source
  host ≠ the account's own host. Those don't change when the attacker swaps tools.
- **Honey tokens are the cheapest high-signal control.** A fake user that no
  human should ever touch, a fake SPN no service should ever request — any hit is
  true-positive by construction. Near-zero false positives, near-zero cost.
- **Coverage is a license/logging problem too.** You can't alert on a log you
  don't keep. Sysmon for process/inject visibility on endpoints; in M365, audit
  retention and the high-value events (MailItemsAccessed, Send) gate on the E5/G5
  tier. Decide what you're blind to *before* the assessment.
- **Red OPSEC is the other side of the same coin.** In-memory `execute-assembly`
  / BOFs avoid the `4688` that a dropped binary or `cmd /c` would write — so the
  defender's answer is endpoint telemetry (Sysmon, AMSI, EDR), not just the
  Windows Security log.

## Attack → detection map (Splunk SPL unless noted)

Queries assume a Windows Security / Sysmon feed in `index=main`. Field names
follow the common Splunk add-on schema — adjust to your CIM/normalization.

> Blocks fenced by `<!-- companion:gen ID -->` markers are **generated** from the
> structured companion (`offensive/companion/entries/`), which is canonical for
> those — edit the entry and run `offensive/companion/gen-views.sh`, not the block
> here (CI rejects a hand-edit). Everything outside the markers is hand-authored.

### Recon / credential access

<!-- companion:gen password-spray-4625 -->
**Detect password spray (4625 one source, many accounts)**

The shape, not the count: one source address failing (`4625`) against many
*distinct* accounts in a short window — the inverse of a single user who simply
forgot their password. Counting distinct accounts per source beats a raw
failure-rate threshold because the spray is deliberately slow.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4625 NOT (Source_Network_Address IN ("-","127.0.0.1"))
| eval Account=mvindex(Account_Name,1)
| stats dc(Account) AS Accounts by host, Source_Network_Address
| where Accounts > 10 | sort -Accounts
```
<!-- companion:end password-spray-4625 -->

<!-- companion:gen asrep-probing-4771 -->
**Detect AS-REP / Kerbrute probing (4771 0x18)**

One client address generating Kerberos pre-auth failures (`4771`, failure code
`0x18`) across many distinct accounts is the spray/roast tell — a real user
fat-fingers their own name, not five-plus others. Tune the threshold to the
environment.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4771 Failure_Code="0x18"
| stats dc(Account_Name) AS UniqueAccounts by host, Client_Address
| where UniqueAccounts > 5
```
<!-- companion:end asrep-probing-4771 -->

<!-- companion:gen kerberoasting-4769 -->
**Detect Kerberoasting (4769 RC4 TGS)**

Detect on the invariant, not the IOC: an RC4 (`0x17`) service ticket for a
non-machine, non-krbtgt SPN. The encryption downgrade is the signal even when
ticket flags look normal — tools like Orpheus force RC4 precisely to keep the
roast crackable, so the downgrade itself is the tell.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4769 Service_Name!="*$" Service_Name!="krbtgt"
    Ticket_Encryption_Type=0x17
| stats dc(Service_Name) AS ServiceAccounts values(Service_Name)
    by Client_Address, Account_Name
| sort -ServiceAccounts
```
<!-- companion:end kerberoasting-4769 -->

<!-- companion:gen golden-ticket-4769 -->
**Detect Golden Ticket (4769 with no preceding 4768)**

A forged TGT is minted offline, so the account uses Kerberos services (`4769` TGS
requests) without the DC ever issuing it a TGT (`4768`). Per account+host window,
a principal with TGS activity but zero TGT issuance is the invariant. Secondary
tells back it up: RC4 (`0x17`) when the realm is otherwise AES, and absurd ticket
lifetimes. Tune the window to your normal ticket-renewal cadence.

```spl
index=main EventCode IN (4768,4769) Account_Name!="*$"
| eval kind=if(EventCode==4768,"tgt","tgs")
| stats count(eval(kind=="tgt")) AS tgts count(eval(kind=="tgs")) AS tgs_reqs
    by Account_Name, Client_Address
| where tgs_reqs > 0 AND tgts == 0
```
<!-- companion:end golden-ticket-4769 -->

<!-- companion:gen silver-ticket-4769 -->
**Detect Silver Ticket (Kerberos service logon with no 4769)**

Detection posture: **soft** — a silver ticket's whole point is that it never
touches the DC, so there is no `4769` to alert on directly. The realistic tell is
the *absence*: a Kerberos network logon (`4624` type 3) landing on a service host
for an account the DC issued no service ticket (`4769`) to in the window. The join
key is `Account_Name` — `4769` is logged on the DC and `4624` on the member host,
so source/host fields don't share values across the two. Set the search/alert
**time range** to your ticket-renewal cadence (a few hours); the subsearch inherits
it, so don't hard-code a window inside it. The durable backstop is enabling PAC
validation, which rejects the forged ticket outright.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=3 Authentication_Package_Name="Kerberos" Account_Name!="*$"
| join type=left Account_Name
    [ search index=main EventCode=4769 | stats count AS tgs_issued by Account_Name ]
| where isnull(tgs_issued)
| table _time, host, Account_Name, Source_Network_Address
```
<!-- companion:end silver-ticket-4769 -->

<!-- companion:gen gpp-cpassword-5145 -->
**Detect GPP cpassword hunt (5145 SYSVOL Groups.xml read)**

The decrypt is offline, so the only on-wire moment is reading the GPP XML out of
SYSVOL — a `5145` detailed-file-share-access event on the `SYSVOL` share whose
relative target ends in a credential-bearing GPP file. Group Policy clients read
these too, so scope to *interactive* accounts (not `*$` machine accounts).
Honey-policy a fake `Groups.xml` for a near-zero-false-positive tripwire.

```spl
index=main EventCode=5145 Share_Name="*SYSVOL*" Account_Name!="*$"
| regex Relative_Target_Name="(?i)(Groups|Services|ScheduledTasks|Printers|DataSources)\.xml$"
| table _time, host, Account_Name, Source_Address, Relative_Target_Name
```
<!-- companion:end gpp-cpassword-5145 -->

**LDAP recon by one principal** — explicit-cred logons `4648` fanning out:
```spl
index=main EventCode=4648 Network_Address!="-"
| stats count by host, Network_Address | sort -count
```

### Poisoning, relay, coercion

<!-- companion:gen ntlm-relay-4624 -->
**Detect NTLM relay (4624 workstation mismatch)**

A relayed logon carries the *victim's* workstation name but arrives from the
*relay's* source address — so the tell is a `4624` whose `Workstation_Name`
doesn't resolve to its `Source_Network_Address`. That mismatch is the invariant;
the attacker can't relay without it.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4624 Workstation_Name!="-" Source_Port!="0"
| eval RelayedFrom=if(host!=Workstation_Name, Workstation_Name, "")
| lookup dnslookup clienthost AS RelayedFrom OUTPUT clientip AS IP
| where RelayedFrom!="" AND Source_Network_Address!=IP
| table _time, host, Account_Name, Source_Network_Address, RelayedFrom, IP
```
<!-- companion:end ntlm-relay-4624 -->

<!-- companion:gen coercion-5145 -->
**Detect coercion (5145 named-pipe access)**

Every coercion vector reaches the same handful of named pipes — `spoolss`,
`efsrpc`, `lsarpc`, `netlogon`, `lsass` — over `IPC$` with a detailed
file-share-access event (`5145`). Detect on the pipe set, not the tool: the
target endpoint can't change even as the coercion technique does.

```spl
index=main EventCode=5145 Access_Mask="0x3"
| regex Share_Name="(?i).*ipc\$$"
| regex Relative_Target_Name="(?i)(spoolss|efsrpc|lsarpc|netlogon|lsass)"
| table _time, host, Account_Name, Source_Address, Share_Name, Relative_Target_Name
```
<!-- companion:end coercion-5145 -->

### Lateral movement & dumping

<!-- companion:gen lateral-4624-fanout -->
**Detect lateral movement (4624 type-3 fan-out)**

One source address logging on (`4624` type 3, network) to many distinct hosts in
a short window is the reuse pattern — pass-the-hash, sprayed creds, or a relay all
fan out the same way. The auth succeeds, so the signal is the breadth, not a
failure.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=3 NOT (Source_Network_Address IN ("-","::1"))
| stats dc(host) AS Hosts by Source_Network_Address
| where Hosts > 2 | sort -Hosts
```
<!-- companion:end lateral-4624-fanout -->

<!-- companion:gen lsass-4656 -->
**Detect LSASS access (4656 dump-shaped handle)**

Credential theft from memory needs a handle to `lsass` with read/dump access
rights — `4656` with a dump-shaped access mask, from any process that isn't the
AV engine, is the signal. Endpoint telemetry (Sysmon 10 process-access) sees this
better than the Security log, but the mask filter catches the obvious cases.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4656 Object_Name=*lsass* TaskCategory="Kernel Object"
    Process_Name!=*MsMpEng.exe
    (Access_Mask="0x1010" OR Access_Mask="0x1410" OR Access_Mask="0x1FFFFF")
| table _time, host, Account_Name, Process_Name, Access_Mask, Object_Name
```
<!-- companion:end lsass-4656 -->

**Remote secrets dump (svcctl/winreg over IPC$/ADMIN$)** — `5145`:
```spl
index=main EventCode=5145 Relative_Target_Name IN ("svcctl","winreg")
| regex Share_Name="(?i).*(ipc|admin)\$$"
| table _time, host, Account_Name, Source_Address, Relative_Target_Name
```

<!-- companion:gen dcsync-4662 -->
**Detect DCSync / NTDS replication (4662)**

A `4662` directory-access event with the replication access mask (`0x100`) from a
non-system SID is the signal — legitimate replication comes from DC machine
accounts, so a user/admin SID requesting it is the anomaly.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4662 Access_Mask="0x100" Security_ID!="S-1-5-18"
| stats count by host, Account_Name, Object_Server | sort -count
```

Tighter: alert on `Properties` containing the **DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All**
extended right `1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2` requested by anything that
isn't a domain controller.
<!-- companion:end dcsync-4662 -->

<!-- companion:gen ntds-ntdsutil-4688 -->
**Detect NTDS theft via ntdsutil/VSS (4688 + 8222)**

Copying NTDS.dit avoids the replication right (`4662`), so detect on host
behavior instead: on a domain controller, `ntdsutil` with an `ifm`/`create full`
argument, or `vssadmin`/`diskshadow`/`wbadmin` creating a shadow copy (`4688`).
Corroborate with the `8222` shadow-copy-created event. Almost nothing legitimately
runs `ntdsutil ... ifm` outside a planned DC backup or migration — allowlist
those windows and alert on the rest.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4688
| regex Process_Command_Line="(?i)(ntdsutil.*(ifm|create\s+full)|vssadmin\s+create\s+shadow|diskshadow|wbadmin\s+start\s+backup)"
| table _time, host, Account_Name, New_Process_Name, Process_Command_Line
```
<!-- companion:end ntds-ntdsutil-4688 -->

<!-- companion:gen wmiexec-4688 -->
**Detect WMI exec (4688 WmiPrvSE child process)**

WMI execution drops no service (`7045`) to catch, but the payload runs as a child
of `WmiPrvSE.exe`. A `4688` whose creator is `WmiPrvSE.exe` spawning
`cmd.exe`/`powershell.exe` is the signal — especially with impacket-wmiexec's
`cmd.exe /Q /c ... 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\...` output-redirect shape. Legitimate
WMI providers spawn children too, so pair the parent with a shell target and the
SMB output-redirect string.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4688 Creator_Process_Name="*\\WmiPrvSE.exe"
    New_Process_Name IN ("*\\cmd.exe","*\\powershell.exe")
| table _time, host, Account_Name, Creator_Process_Name, New_Process_Name, Process_Command_Line
```
<!-- companion:end wmiexec-4688 -->

### Execution, persistence, AD CS

**LOLBAS execution** — `4688` process creation, regex on known abuse shapes:
```spl
index=main EventCode=4688
| regex Process_Command_Line="(?i)(\.(hta|sct)|msbuild\.exe|^hh\s|,ShellExec_RunDLL|regasm|process\s+call\s+create|/u\s+.*\.dll|urlcache.*(http|file))"
| table _time, host, Account_Name, New_Process_Name, Process_Command_Line
```

**Obfuscated command lines** — `4688` heavy in `,` `^` `%`:
```spl
index=main EventCode=4688 (Process_Command_Line="*,*" OR Process_Command_Line="*^*" OR Process_Command_Line="*%*")
| eval n=len(Process_Command_Line)-len(replace(Process_Command_Line,"[,^%]",""))
| where n > 1
```

**Service creation (psexec / RDP-hijack service)** — `7045`, allowlist the known:
```spl
index=main EventCode=7045 Service_Name!="MpKsl*"
| regex Service_File_Name!="(?i)(SplunkUniversalForwarder|Microsoft.Net\\Framework64)"
| table _time, host, Service_Name, Service_File_Name, Service_Account
```

<!-- companion:gen rdp-hijack-4688 -->
**Detect RDP session hijack (4688 tscon)**

The hijack can't happen without a `tscon ... /dest:rdp-tcp#` command line, so the
process-creation event (`4688`) carrying that argument is a near-zero-false-
positive tell — legitimate admins almost never `tscon` to a different session's
RDP endpoint by hand.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4688
| regex Process_Command_Line="(?i)/dest:rdp-tcp#"
```
<!-- companion:end rdp-hijack-4688 -->

<!-- companion:gen potato-seimpersonate-4688 -->
**Detect Potato privesc (service account → SYSTEM shell, 4688)**

Detection posture: **moderate** — the impersonation itself is a legitimate API,
and `4688` alone can't show the new process's run-as-SYSTEM result. So this query
flags the *shape* it can see — a service identity (app-pool / `*$` / NETWORK|LOCAL
SERVICE) spawning an interactive shell — and you confirm the SYSTEM outcome with
endpoint telemetry: Sysmon 17/18 on the `spoolss`/DCOM named pipe, plus Sysmon 1
correlating the parent service process to a SYSTEM child. Tune the service-account
list to your environment.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4688 New_Process_Name IN ("*\\cmd.exe","*\\powershell.exe")
    Account_Name IN ("*$","*APPPOOL*","NETWORK SERVICE","LOCAL SERVICE")
| table _time, host, Account_Name, Creator_Process_Name, New_Process_Name, Process_Command_Line
```
<!-- companion:end potato-seimpersonate-4688 -->

**Rogue account creation** — `4720` (created), pair with `4722` (enabled):
```spl
index=main EventCode IN (4720,4722)
| eval Creator=mvindex(Account_Name,0), NewAccount=mvindex(Account_Name,1)
| table _time, host, Creator, NewAccount
```

<!-- companion:gen schtask-4698 -->
**Detect scheduled-task persistence (4698 task created)**

Task creation writes `4698` with the full task XML in the event. Detect on the
action, not the name: a task whose command runs encoded/hidden PowerShell, a
LOLBin, or something from a user-writable/temp path. Baseline your software's
legit tasks and alert on the rest; `4702` (task updated) catches the
modify-an-existing-task variant. (Needs the Object Access > Other Object Access
audit subcategory enabled.)

```spl
index=main EventCode=4698
| regex Task_Content="(?i)(-enc\b|-w\s+hidden|FromBase64|\\\\Users\\\\|\\\\Temp\\\\|mshta|regsvr32|rundll32|powershell.*(http|iex))"
| table _time, host, Subject_Account_Name, Task_Name, Task_Content
```
<!-- companion:end schtask-4698 -->

<!-- companion:gen wmi-subscription-sysmon -->
**Detect WMI subscription persistence (Sysmon 20 consumer)**

The Security log barely sees this; Sysmon does. The WMI-eventing family is Sysmon
`19` (WmiFilter), `20` (WmiConsumer), `21` (WmiBinding). The command lives in the
consumer, so this query keys on event `20` and matches its `Destination` — a
`CommandLineEventConsumer` running PowerShell/cmd/a LOLBin is the high-fidelity
tell. The binding (`21`) and filter (`19`) carry no command, so don't fold them
into this `Destination` regex; instead treat **any** new `21`
(`__FilterToConsumerBinding`) as its own cheap, low-volume alert. Legitimate
permanent consumers are rare and usually from known management software, so
allowlist those and alert on the rest. Requires Sysmon with WMI eventing
(schema ≥ 4.1).

```spl
index=main EventCode=20
| regex Destination="(?i)(powershell|cmd\.exe|mshta|wscript|cscript|rundll32|-enc|FromBase64)"
| table _time, host, User, Name, Type, Destination, Query
```
<!-- companion:end wmi-subscription-sysmon -->

<!-- companion:gen adcs-esc1-4886 -->
**Detect AD CS SAN abuse (4886 ESC1/relay)**

The invariant of ESC1 (and relay-to-ADCS) is a certificate request whose
subject-alternative-name names a *different* principal than the requester — pull
the requested SAN out of the `4886` event and compare it to the `Requester`.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4886
| rex field=Message "SAN\s*:.*upn=(?<RequestedSAN>.+$)"
| table _time, host, Requester, RequestedSAN
```

Also watch `5136` writes to the `userCertificate` attribute.
<!-- companion:end adcs-esc1-4886 -->

### Delegation & key-trust abuse

<!-- companion:gen shadow-credentials-5136 -->
**Detect Shadow Credentials (5136 msDS-KeyCredentialLink write)**

The attack *must* write the `msDS-KeyCredentialLink` attribute — so a `5136`
directory-object-modified event naming that attribute is the invariant. Almost
nothing legitimately writes it except Windows Hello for Business enrollment, so
scope out those known sources and alert on the rest. (Requires the directory-
service-access audit subcategory + a SACL on the objects.)

```spl
index=main EventCode=5136 Attribute_LDAP_Display_Name="msDS-KeyCredentialLink"
| table _time, host, Subject_Account_Name, Object_DN, Operation_Type
```
<!-- companion:end shadow-credentials-5136 -->

<!-- companion:gen rbcd-5136 -->
**Detect RBCD abuse (5136 msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity write)**

Configuring RBCD means writing `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` on the
target computer — a `5136` naming that attribute is the invariant. Legitimately
it's set by admins delegating a service; a write sourced from a normal user (not a
delegation admin) onto a computer object is the anomaly. Pair with a `4741`
computer-account-created burst (the attacker's machine account) for higher
fidelity.

```spl
index=main EventCode=5136 Attribute_LDAP_Display_Name="msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity"
| table _time, host, Subject_Account_Name, Object_DN, Operation_Type
```
<!-- companion:end rbcd-5136 -->

<!-- companion:gen unconstrained-deleg-4624 -->
**Detect unconstrained-deleg abuse (DC machine-account auth to a non-DC, 4624)**

Detection posture: **soft** — the TGT caching is legitimate Kerberos. The realistic
tell is the coerced auth *landing*: a domain controller's computer account doing a
network logon (`4624`) to a host that isn't a DC, which DCs essentially never do.
Allowlist your DC computer accounts and DC hosts below. Best paired with the
coercion alert (`coercion-5145`) firing just before, and with config hygiene —
inventory `TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION` accounts that shouldn't have it.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=3 Account_Name="*$"
| search Account_Name IN ("DC1$","DC2$")
| where NOT (host IN ("DC1","DC2"))
| table _time, host, Account_Name, Source_Network_Address
```
<!-- companion:end unconstrained-deleg-4624 -->

<!-- companion:gen dcshadow-4742 -->
**Detect DCShadow (rogue DC registration, 4742 GC SPN)**

DCShadow has to make the directory believe a non-DC is a DC, and that leaves
prints: a computer account gets a `GC/...` (global-catalog) service principal name
added (`4742`), a server/`nTDSDSA` object is created under the Sites container
(`5137`), and replication (`4662`) then originates from a host that is not a real
DC. The SPN write is the cleanest invariant — alert on a `GC/` SPN appearing on
any account that isn't an established domain controller.

```spl
index=main EventCode=4742 Service_Principal_Names="*GC/*"
| search NOT Target_Account_Name IN ("DC1$","DC2$")
| table _time, host, Account_Name, Target_Account_Name, Service_Principal_Names
```

Corroborate with `5137` creating an `nTDSDSA`/server object, and `4662` replication
(`DS-Replication-Get-Changes`) sourced from a host outside your DC inventory.
<!-- companion:end dcshadow-4742 -->

<!-- companion:gen dpapi-backupkey-5145 -->
**Detect DPAPI backup-key theft (protected_storage pipe, 5145)**

Detection posture: **narrow but real** — the backup-key retrieval rides MS-BKRP
over the DC's `protected_storage` named pipe (`5145`), and almost nothing but a
genuine domain backup operation touches it. A non-backup principal accessing
`protected_storage` on a DC is the tell. The *offline* decryption that follows is
invisible — this RPC is the only on-wire moment. Needs detailed file-share
auditing on DCs.

```spl
index=main EventCode=5145 Relative_Target_Name="protected_storage"
| regex Share_Name="(?i).*ipc\$$"
| table _time, host, Account_Name, Source_Address, Share_Name, Relative_Target_Name
```
<!-- companion:end dpapi-backupkey-5145 -->

## Honey tokens (build these before you're attacked)

- **Honey user** — a never-used account; any `4625`/`4624` referencing it is real.
  ```spl
  index=main EventCode=4625 TERM("<honey-username>")
  ```
- **Honey SPN** — register a fake SPN (`setspn -A MSSQLSvc/fake:1433 <acct>`); any
  `4769` for it means someone enumerated/roasted SPNs:
  ```spl
  index=main EventCode=4769 Service_Name="<honey-spn-account>"
  ```
- **Responder honeypot (HoneyCreds)** — broadcast fake creds so an attacker's
  Responder/relay tooling bites a poisoned credential you can alarm on.
