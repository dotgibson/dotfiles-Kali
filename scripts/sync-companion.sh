# scripts/sync-companion.sh — pull the latest companion from upstream htpx and
# refresh companion.lock. The consumer-side half of the vendoring contract.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# offensive/companion/ is a vendored `git subtree` of dotgibson/htpx (provenance in
# companion.lock). Upstream is the source of truth; this is the one command that
# re-pulls htpx `main` into the prefix AND records the new git-subtree-split sha in
# companion.lock, so the lock can never drift from what's actually vendored. It is
# the convenience wrapper the lock's own header points at — nothing it does is
# magic, just the documented `git subtree pull --squash` + the sha bump in one step.
#
#   scripts/sync-companion.sh                  # pull companion_branch (main) from the lock's URL
#   scripts/sync-companion.sh <remote-or-url>  # pull from a specific remote / URL / local clone
#   scripts/sync-companion.sh --ref vX.Y.Z     # pull an EXACT tag/branch instead of companion_branch
#   scripts/sync-companion.sh --check          # report whether upstream is ahead; touch nothing
#
# --ref exists for a REPRODUCIBLE backfill of a specific htpx release: `git subtree pull`
# (and --check's `git ls-remote`) resolve a tag or branch NAME, so pass a release tag —
# NOT a raw commit sha (ls-remote lists refs, it can't look up a bare sha). A bare run
# always pulls companion_branch's TIP, so backfilling an OLD release tag would silently
# vendor CURRENT main instead of that tag's tree. htpx's sync-fanout workflow passes the
# released tag via --ref so the fan-out is exact (G10).
#
# A bare run leaves you with TWO things to do before it's a finished change:
#   1. eyeball the diff under offensive/companion/, and
#   2. run offensive/companion/gen-views.sh --check — an upstream content change can
#      shift the generated blocks in hacktheplanet / PURPLE-TEAM.md, which this
#      script does NOT touch (that's gen-views.sh's job). Fix + commit both together.
#
# Pre-reqs the script enforces: a clean working tree (git subtree pull refuses to
# run otherwise) and a companion.lock it can read the repo/branch from. The prefix
# (offensive/companion) is fixed — it's where the subtree was added — not read from
# the lock.
