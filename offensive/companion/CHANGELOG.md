# Changelog

All notable changes to **htpx** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

htpx is the source of truth for the red↔blue paired corpus; it is vendored into
`dotfiles-Kali` at `offensive/companion/` via `git subtree`. Cutting a release
here (a new top version below) tags the repo and fans the change OUT to
`dotfiles-Kali` as a `companion.lock`-bump PR — see
`.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml` and `.github/workflows/sync-fanout.yml`.

## How releasing works

Add user-visible changes under `[Unreleased]`. To cut a release, move the
`[Unreleased]` entries under a new `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading and push to
`main`: `auto-tag.yml` sees the new top version, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and publishes a
GitHub Release; `sync-fanout.yml` then opens the Kali sync PR.

## [Unreleased]

## [v2.5.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Cloud Collection parity — 1 new red↔blue pair (`T1530` Data from Cloud
  Storage).** Fills the corpus's thinnest tactic: `aws-s3-mass-exfil` (bulk
  `ListBucket` → `GetObject`/`sync`, or server-side `CopyObject` into an attacker
  bucket) ↔ `aws-s3-exfil-cloudtrail` (per-principal object-read volume via
  CloudTrail S3 data events, with a caveat that data events must be enabled and an
  S3-server-access-log / `BytesDownloaded` fallback). S3 is the canonical
  cloud-exfil target and was previously uncovered.

### Changed

- **`web-service-c2-beacon` inverted to a process-centric gate.** The detection now
  triggers on non-browser / user-writable-path processes making periodic 443 SaaS
  beacons rare-for-the-host, instead of a hardcoded 4-domain allowlist that any
  other trusted-SaaS C2 (Discord, Dropbox, Pastebin, …) evaded silently. The four
  domains are demoted to a labelled seed IOC list, matching the red entry's "the
  tell is the _process_."
- **`adcs-esc1-4886` retargeted to 4887 with a SAN-logging caveat.** Primary now
  keys on `4887` (certificate _issued_) plus CA request-attribute auditing; adds a
  caveat that the `4886` `upn=` parse is best-effort and can silently miss without CA
  auditing, and separates the `5136 userCertificate` line as shadow-cred/relay
  telemetry rather than an ESC1-SAN backstop.
- **`mass-encrypt-4663` now ships the Sysmon-11 FileCreate variant as primary.**
  File-data SACLs are off by default, so the 4663-only query was blind
  out-of-the-box; the Sysmon-11 branch the prose already advertised is now
  implemented and preferred (no SACL required).
- **`mtls-c2-ja3` refreshed toward JA4/JA4S.** Notes that JA3 is increasingly
  defeated by TLS randomization (uTLS) and to prefer JA4/JA4S (FoxIO, 2023+, emitted
  by current Zeek) where available.

## [v2.4.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **GCP parity — 2 new red↔blue pairs (+4 entries) and a recon entry (+1).** Brings
  GCP up from a single pair to rough parity with the other big-three clouds.
  **Persistence** (`T1098`): IAM policy backdoor — `setIamPolicy` binding a rogue
  principal — detected on the `SetIamPolicy` `ADD` binding delta in Cloud Audit
  Logs. **Defense Evasion** (`T1562.008`): Cloud Audit log tamper — `DeleteSink` /
  `auditConfigs` strip — detected via the self-witnessing Admin Activity events
  (plus a Data Access gap monitor). Also adds an unpaired **Discovery**
  (`T1580`/`T1526`/`T1069.003`) `gcp-enum-recon` entry (projects / Asset Inventory /
  IAM blast-radius mapping), mirroring the unpaired on-prem `smb-enum-nxc`.

### Changed

- **`asrep-probing-4771` retargeted to the real AS-REP roast artifact.** The
  detection now keys primarily on a _successful_ `4768` with pre-authentication
  type 0 (the AS-REP etype is negotiated — often RC4 `0x17`, AES where RC4 is
  disabled — so the clause keys on the type-0 invariant, not the cipher) — the
  roastable AS-REP its red mate actually emits — and keeps
  the `4771 0x18` one-source-many-accounts burst as a secondary Kerbrute
  enumeration/spray tell. Previously it only saw the collateral `4771` probing, not
  the roast itself.

## [v2.3.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Command & Control + Impact corpus (14 new red↔blue pairs, +28 entries).** Fills
  the two tactics that had **zero** coverage. **`TA0011` Command & Control** (8 pairs):
  HTTPS beacon sleep+jitter, DNS tunneling, domain fronting, mutual-TLS/JA3, ICMP
  tunneling, web-service C2 (Telegram/Slack/Gist), DGA rendezvous, and reverse
  tunnels (chisel/ligolo) — each attack paired with the network/host detection that
  survives its evasion (inter-arrival regularity, Sysmon-22 query shape, SNI/Host
  mismatch, JA3 fingerprints, NXDOMAIN entropy). **`TA0040` Impact** (6 pairs):
  recovery inhibition (`vssadmin`/`wbadmin`/`bcdedit`), mass file encryption, pre-
  encryption service kills, cloud data destruction (CloudTrail delete burst),
  cryptojacking (Stratum), and account access removal (4724/4725/4726). Corpus-only
  (no flat-view markers); every new entry carries a valid, non-deprecated ATT&CK
  technique ID.

## [v2.2.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **`/corpus-review` maintenance routine** (`.claude/commands/corpus-review.md` +
  `.github/workflows/claude-routines.yml`). A weekly, report-first Claude routine that
  reviews the judgment layer `ci.yml` can't gate: ATT&CK-ID validity (against live
  MITRE), red↔blue **semantic** pairing fidelity, coverage holes, and detection
  quality. Files a deduplicated issue and changes nothing. **Inert by default** —
  scaffolded but dormant until a `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` repo secret is added. Runs
  Thu 08:00 UTC, off the rest of the fleet's routine crons.
- **`/release-readiness` + `/release-notes` routines** (`.claude/commands/` + two new
  dispatch-only jobs in `claude-routines.yml`). The htpx twin of Core's release
  routines: `release-readiness` reads the Conventional Commits + CHANGELOG since the
  last tag and files a **go/no-go verdict with the recommended next SemVer**;
  `release-notes` drafts the CHANGELOG entry from those commits. Both report-first and
  dispatch-only — run them at release time via **Actions → claude-routines → Run
  workflow → routine**. Same inert-by-default token gate.

### Fixed

- **ATT&CK tactic corrections surfaced by the first `/corpus-review` run** (T1195.002,
  T1047), both verified against live MITRE:
  - `T1195.002` (Compromise Software Supply Chain) is an **Initial Access** technique,
    not Execution — retagged `TA0002` → `TA0001` (+ phase) in the npm/pypi
    malicious-publish pair (4 entries).
  - `T1047` (WMI) is filed by MITRE only under **Execution**, not Lateral Movement —
    retagged `TA0008` → `TA0002` (+ phase) in the wmiexec pair (2 entries).
    Red↔blue tags stay in agreement; pairings unchanged, so `ci.yml`'s pairing/slot/drift
    gates are unaffected.

### Internal

- Hardened the report-first routines' "change nothing" guarantee into a mechanical one
  (read-only `--permission-mode default`; read-only Bash allowlists; tightened git
  allowlist) and fixed a `sync-fanout` tag-resolve race that could throw a spurious red
  X on CHANGELOG-only merges. Renovate action-pin bumps.

## [v2.1.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- `renovate.json` - configuration for Renovate app.

## [v2.0.0] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- **README second-pass polish.** The `dotgibson` shield now tracks the
  `dotfiles-core` release version; dropped the showcase and LinkedIn shields for a
  one-line header (LinkedIn moved to Contact); the docs links now point at the
  documentation hub root (`/docs`); and About gained `Languages` (Markdown) +
  `Tools` (MITRE ATT&CK, fzf) subsections.
- **README rebuilt as a lean showcase landing page.** Brought the README up to the
  `dotgibson` exemplar bar — a reference-style shields header, the org logo, a
  collapsible TOC, then a lean body (what htpx is and how it's vendored into
  `dotfiles-Kali`, Getting Started, a representative corpus slice, and the
  entry-first contribution workflow). The full 70+-row corpus table is trimmed to
  a representative sample that points at `entries/` and the on-site red↔blue view.
  Added a `.markdownlint.jsonc` (mirrored from Core) scoping the showcase HTML via
  MD033 `allowed_elements`.

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- `sync-fanout.yml` Sync step: call Kali's `sync-companion.sh` with NO argument.
  It was passed `main` as a positional, but that arg is the REMOTE (URL), not a
  branch so it tried to pull from a remote named `main` (`fatal: 'main' does
not appear to be a git repository`). The script derives both the htpx remote
  and the branch (`main`) from `companion.lock` itself.
- `sync-fanout.yml` auth: the Sync step now injects all git auth + the bot identity
  via step-scoped `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`/`KEY`/`VALUE` instead of `git config --global`
  (no token written to `~/.gitconfig`; consistent with the Resolve step).
  htpx is read with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` via a more-specific,
  `.git`-anchored `url.insteadOf` (longest match wins, and the anchor avoids
  rewriting same-prefix repos like `<owner>/htpx-tools`), so the
  `git subtree pull` works without `FLEET_SYNC_TOKEN` ever needing htpx access;
  `FLEET_SYNC_TOKEN` stays scoped to the dotfiles-Kali clone/push/PR.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- `sync-fanout.yml` Resolve step: the htpx clone / `ls-remote` reads are now
  authenticated with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`contents: read`). They were
  unauthenticated, so on a private htpx the fan-out died at the first clone with
  `could not read Username for 'https://github.com'`. Auth is injected via
  `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`/`KEY`/`VALUE` env (an `url.insteadOf` rewrite scoped to that
  step), so the token is never written to `~/.gitconfig` and can't shadow the next
  step's `actions/checkout`; `FLEET_SYNC_TOKEN` stays reserved for the cross-repo
  writes to dotfiles-Kali.
- Release + fan-out workflows hardened (PR review): `auto-tag.sh` now fails loud
  when `--release` is requested but `gh` is absent; `auto-tag.yml` cuts
  tags/releases only from the default branch; `sync-fanout.yml` resolves and
  verifies the tag exists before checkout (a bad dispatch input is a clean no-op),
  aborts the sync if `gen-views.sh` fails (no PR), and fails on ANY `core.lock`
  diff versus the base branch — not just the `core_sha` field.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Release automation: `auto-tag.yml` tags + releases on a new top CHANGELOG
  version, and `sync-fanout.yml` fans the released ref out to `dotfiles-Kali`
  as a `companion.lock`-bump PR this CHANGELOG seeds that pipeline at the
  current tag.

## [v1.1.0]

### Added

- Polished README landing-page hero.

## [v1.0.0]

### Added

- Initial standalone extraction of the structured red↔blue paired companion from
  `dotfiles-Kali`: `htpx` fzf browser, `gen-views.sh` source-of-truth bridge with
  `--check` drift gate, and the ATT&CK-tagged `entries/red|blue/*.md` corpus.
